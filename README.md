ðŸ”§ Core Components
1. Window Manager Layer (T81WM)

Built on a modernized fork of Project Looking Glass
Rendered using LWJGL or jMonkeyEngine to replace outdated Java3D
Every window is a 3D object with Axion metadata overlays (AI context, logs, T81 state)
Supports ternary-focused navigation: tilt/rotate to represent state (-1, 0, 1)


2. Axion AI Integration

Contextual AI assistant docked as a rotating globe or virtual agent in 3D space
Learns window behavior, predicts task flows, reorders workspace dynamically
Backs of windows display AI notes, diffs, or logs (with transparency sliders)


3. Ternary System Visualizations

Live ternary register view: colored vertical towers representing -1/0/1 values
T81VM debugger: float above the desktop, breakpoints visualized as ripples
Ternary memory explorer: browse heap/stack in 3D space


4. T81Lang Dev Suite Integration

Open source .t81 or .cweb files as living windows: AI suggests edits visually
Errors shown as red glows; optimizations as green pulses
Compile results rendered as beams connecting modules (think Star Trek LCARS + Matrix)


ðŸ’¡ User Interactions

Action	Result

Rotate window left	Shift to state -1 (e.g., paused, hidden, backgrounded)
Center a window	State 0 (neutral, idle, queued)
Rotate right	State 1 (active, focused, live)
Flip window back	Show AI-generated summary, logs, or "thoughts"
Zoom out	See full ternary system map or program state in top-down cube layout
Pinch to collapse	Merge windows into a stack/module group
